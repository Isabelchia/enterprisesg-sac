Signatories to regional and international MRAs are subject to regular and stringent multi-national peer evaluations. The purpose is to verify signatoriesâ€™ continual conformance with the internationally accepted criteria. These peer evaluations ensure consistent accreditation practices and facilitate the exchange of information and experience among the signatories.

SAC has developed a number of formal relationships with international/regional organisations. Some of them include International Accreditation Forum (IAF), Pacific Accreditation Co-operation (PAC), International Laboratory Accreditation Co-operation (ILAC), Asia Pacific Laboratory Accreditation Co-operation (APLAC), ASEAN Consultative Committee for Standards and Quality (ACCSQ) and Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). SAC participates in various committees within these organisations and OECD GLP Working Group. In addition, SAC participates in relevant ISO/CASCO working groups.

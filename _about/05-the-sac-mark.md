## SAC Accreditation Marks

![SAC Marks](/images/about/sac-marks.jpg)

SAC Marks are trademarks registered under IPOS (Intellectual Property Office of Singapore). The marks help to identify conformity assessment bodies and services that have been accredited by SAC.

When you've acquired accreditation, you will obtain a SAC Accreditation Mark. The stylised star and tick depicts excellence and approval. The brush stroke reflects vibrancy and dynamism. The SAC Accreditation Mark on the whole represents global quality standards and outstanding results.

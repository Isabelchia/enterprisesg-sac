## For Businesses

Accreditation offers assurance in the integrity of conformity assessment reports and certificates of your products or services, thereby instilling confidence in stakeholders and promoting differentiated products and services to your customers. 

* **Reduced risk and higher level of quality assurance**:  
Take the guesswork out of choosing a CAB. SAC accredited CABs have been assessed according to internationally recognised conformity assessment frameworks, thereby ensuring that you get the quality service that best fulfils your requirements.  

* **Reduced costs**:  
With accreditation, you save cost from the removal or reduction of: 
  * Product failure  
  * Downtime  
  * Re-testing  
  * Re-auditing  
  
* **Facilitates global trade**:  
Overseas markets will be more ready to accept  the reports of an accredited CAB, hence minimising technical barriers to trade.  
As SAC is a signatory to many regional and international arrangements, this means that products and services that are tested and/or certified by accredited CABs in Singapore will also be more readily accepted in these signatory countries. By engaging a SAC accredited CAB, you will open more doors to business opportunities worldwide.

## For Regulators/ Specifiers

Accreditation gives regulators/specifiers greater confidence and trust in the services provided by CABs. This helps regulators/specifiers better evaluate for compliance, as part of fulfilling their obligations in policy setting and regulation. Accreditation also builds and reinforces public confidence in regulators/specifiers' commitment in ensuring public safety, health and environment protection.

Additionally, accreditation helps to improve efficiency by eliminating the need for re-testing and re-sampling of goods and services. This is done through SAC's independent assessment of CABs, which provides objective assurance that that they have met applicable standards.

## For Conformity Assessment Bodies

Increase confidence in the integrity of your certifications and reports with accreditation. You can be assured that the results of your conformity assessments meet prevailing industry standards and best practices. Besides enhanced transparency, fair competition and service quality, the accreditation process also reveals any gaps in non-conformity to help you improve your operational performance.

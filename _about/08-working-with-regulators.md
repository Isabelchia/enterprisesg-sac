## What is Accreditation?

Accreditation is the independent evaluation of conformity assessment bodies against recognised standards to ensure their impartiality and competence to carry out conformity assessment activities, such as testing, calibration, inspection and certification.

The accreditation programmes relevant to regulators would be those that are related to health, safety, and the environment. All countries have regulations related to safety of goods and services. There are also requirements regarding environmental impact, from recycling to energy consumption.

SAC is a Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA) Signatory to various international organisations including [ILAC](https://ilac.org/){:target="&#95;blank"}, [IAF](https://www.iaf.nu/){:target="&#95;blank"}, [APAC](https://www.apac-accreditation.org/){:target="&#95;blank"}. Countries which are signatories of the MRA recognise that their partners' conformity assessment bodies operate in an equivalent way and that they deliver equivalent accreditations, providing the same level of competence and confidence.

Because government bodies and regulations constantly have to make informed decisions on vital issues such as public welfare, environmental protection, development of new regulations and requirements, as well as allotment of resources, they must have confidence in the data generated by the laboratories that carry out testing and measurement of calibration in these specific fields. This is where an accredited laboratory comes in to help establish this confidence.

An accreditation body conducts a thorough evaluation of a CAB in its practises, staff and management. CABs are evaluated against international standards such as the ISO/IEC 17020, 17021, 17025, Guide 65. Accredited CABs are regularly re-examined to ensure continual compliance to the accreditation requirements, so that they maintain a high quality standard of technical expertise and competency.

Some benefits of accreditation include:

* **Allowing flexibility**:  
Regulators are able to set the overall policy and regulation, while relying on the accredited conformity assessment bodies to evaluate compliance.
 
* **Reducing overheads**:  
Costs are lowered due to the elimination of re-testing, re-sampling and lost time (both locally and globally), improved efficiency of the assessment process, as well as removing the need for regulators to employ and manage its own audit personnel thus avoiding duplicate audits.

* **Increasing confidence**:  
As a demonstration of competency, accreditation increases confidence in data that is crucial in decision-making, thus increasing public confidence and reinforcing its commitment to assuring public safety, health and environment protection.
 
* **Procurement decision**:  
As the major procurers of goods and services, the government may rely on accredited services to inform their buying decisions, as it provides confidence that suppliers have the appropriate systems in place to deliver the requirements.

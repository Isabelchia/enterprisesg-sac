    section-subtitle: What is Accreditation?
    section-description: Accreditation enhances the credibility of laboratory tests, inspection, certification reports and certificates by providing reliable third party assurance that these services are conducted professionally and meet globally-recognised standards. Conformity Assessment Bodies (CABs) – such as testing and calibration laboratories, as well as certification and inspection bodies – are benchmarked against international standards. This ensures the competency, impartiality and performance capability of their services.

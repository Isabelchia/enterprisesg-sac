![Aviation & Aerospace Industries](/images/industries/aviation.jpg)

The Singapore aerospace industry has been growing steadily along with the rise in global air travel and technological advancements. Majority of the local industry players are involved in manufacturing of metal-related parts, and maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) work. In particular, Singapore’s aerospace industry accounts for a quarter of Asia’s MRO output, and is also one of the continent’s largest cargo airports. Much of this is possible because of the infrastructure in place, such as Changi Airport and Seletar Aerospace Park, which strengthen Singapore’s position as a leading aerospace hub equipped with R&D and manufacturing capabilities. 

The aerospace industry is strictly regulated, and this is necessary because failure to comply could result in significant repercussions, as evidenced from recent aviation accidents. Conformity assessment plays a key role in assuring the safety, quality and performance of aircraft and aviation components, and accreditation by the SAC helps to increase confidence in the quality of services provided by conformity assessment bodies. 

MRO work is highly reliant on qualified personnel, so personnel certification is naturally a relevant conformity assessment service for businesses in MRO. Additionally, equipment and instruments which may be used in order to carry out MRO work can be tested and certified as well, to ensure their functionality. SAC also has an accreditation scheme for validation and verification bodies for the reduction and removal of greenhouse gases. 

For manufacturers of aerospace parts or components, certification is an important aspect of conformity assessment. Examples of relevant certifications which manufacturers may wish to obtain include certification for quality management systems, as well as occupational safety and health management. Aside from general ISO standards, aviation components suppliers would need to be at least AS 9100 certified. AS 9100 is a quality management system standard laid out specifically for the aerospace industry, based on ISO 9001. Other conformity assessment services relevant to components manufacturers include environmental testing, tests for outdoor durability, as well as resistance to corrosion and weathering. Non-destructive testing and inspection, and calibration may also be necessary for components makers. 

The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore is the regulatory body governing the aerospace industry in Singapore, and it lays out specific requirements with regard to conformity assessment.

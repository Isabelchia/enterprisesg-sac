![Construction and Build Environment](/images/industries/construction.jpg)

The infrastructure sector in Singapore covers the real estate and built environment industries, with total construction demand in 2018 amounting to $30.5 billion. Recent emerging technologies are enabling shorter construction times and innovative methods, and driving the growth of smart cities powered by data and smart technologies. Smart cities are also gaining traction, with the development of physical infrastructure that can support smart city technologies and physical devices connected to IoT networks. However, safety remains a key consideration even in light of the growing need to build more quickly and cheaply.

Conformity assessment is able to provide assurance over quality and safety, ensuring that developments in construction methods and materials used are not at the expense of public safety. What this implies for builders is greater customer confidence in safety at every stage of construction, which could also potentially translate into a competitive advantage. SAC-accredited conformity assessment bodies (CABs) are capable of providing a variety of testing, inspection and certification services relevant to the industry at each stage of a buildingâ€™s life cycle.

At the construction stage, CABs are able to provide lab testing and certification for construction materials (e.g. polymers, ready-mixed concrete), while inspection may be conducted on structural steelwork and lifting equipment. Aside from general certification schemes for quality and occupational safety, firms in the construction industry may also be certified for other management systems (e.g. environmental, energy) in addition to more construction-specific systems including mechanical, electrical and plumbing (MEP), fire, and security. 

After the infrastructure has been constructed, tests may also be conducted to validate functionality and safety. Towards the end of the building lifecycle, retrofits may be necessary and certification bodies are able to certify modified lifting equipment as well.

In Singapore, the Building and Construction Authority is the regulatory body governing the construction industry, and it lays out specific requirements with regard to conformity assessment.

![Digital/ICT Industry](/images/industries/digital-ict.jpg)

ICT is an all-encompassing term used to refer to communication networks, the internet, computing services and media, amongst others. The fourth industrial revolution, otherwise known as the Internet of Things, is impacting and driving digitisation across industries. There are particular implications for businesses involved in manufacturing, with the possibility of autonomous communication between machines and systems quickly becoming reality. Elsewhere in the industry, technology is also increasing network connectivity, driving developments in cloud computing, internet businesses and telecommunications. 

However, increasing digital dependence also increases vulnerability to digital threats. As cyber risks become more sophisticated, companies have to implement and constantly strengthen cybersecurity systems in order to protect themselves and their customers. The Common Criteria is an international standard (ISO 15408) which testing laboratories may use to validate claims over computer security products. ISO 27001 is another standard, for information security management systems (ISMS), which companies can be certified against. It stipulates requirements for establishing, implementing, monitoring and improving ISMS, helping organisations counter threats of data theft and damage. SAC has accreditation schemes for conformity assessment bodies offering such testing and certification services, providing added assurance and credibility. 

The Singapore Standard SS 584:2015 is set out specifically for multi-tiered cloud computing security, and specifies three different tiers of security certification qualified with types of services (e.g. IaaS, PaaS, SaaS), which cloud service providers may consider as well. 

Other conformity assessment services relevant to ICT include quality management system certifications, which enable firms to continuously manage quality and identify areas for improvement. Certification for management of end-of-life ICT equipment may also be relevant to your business, and demonstrates an organisationâ€™s efforts to manage end-of-life equipment in environmentally sustainable ways. 

In Singapore, the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore and Infocomm Media Development Agency are the government bodies which regulate the industry, laying out specific requirements with regard to conformity assessment.

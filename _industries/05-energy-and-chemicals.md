Singapore is one of the world’s leading chemical hubs, with more than 100 global chemical firms locating major operations here. As one of the world’s largest refinery export hubs and top chemical exporters, Singapore’s energy and chemicals industry is set to create $12.7 billion in value-add by 2025. However, safety remains a key priority even as rapid developments are changing production processes and systems. Conformity assessment is able to ensure both safety and quality at every stage of production, and is often a requirement from both regulators and customers. 

A variety of conformity assessment services are available from the procurement to operational stages. Conformity Assessment Bodies (CABs) are able to provide testing and certification of personnel and components, as well as calibration of high-precision measuring devices. SAC has accreditation schemes for laboratories and bodies offering these services, adding further assurance over the credibility of assessment. 

The energy industry can be grouped into petroleum, gas, electrical, coal and renewables. For petroleum refiners and other oil companies in particular, CABs are able to inspect and validate fuel quality in addition to the services outlined above. Laboratories test for gas compositions and even LNG ship calibration to meet the needs of gas industry players, while coal industry needs such as cargo inspection are catered to as well. Infrastructure maintenance is also of importance for businesses in the industry, and conformity assessment services such as mechanical testing and inspection of pressure vessels can help ensure the continued functionality of important equipment.

Sustainability issues are gaining traction, and industry players may wish to undergo conformity assessment relating to them too. For example, SAC has an accreditation scheme for validation and verification bodies, for the reduction and removal of greenhouse gases. 

Management systems certifications which apply across industries are also relevant to those in energy and chemicals, particularly those relating to quality and occupational safety and health.

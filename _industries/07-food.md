Food manufacturing is the process by which livestock and agriculture are transformed into food products for consumption. Employing more than 48,000 workers in Singapore, the industry accounts for 1.1% of our GDP ($4.3 billion in revenue), with more than half of the industry’s output exported. Major exports include alcoholic beverages, milk powder, and chocolate/ cocoa products. 

Food services is another key component in the value chain. Unlike food manufacturing, it is concerned with the sale of food and beverages for immediate consumption. This group of businesses includes restaurants, self-serve chains and kiosks, and food courts. 

Accreditation and conformity assessment benefits players in the food industry by safeguarding customers and ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements at all stages across the industry’s value chain. SAC-accredited Conformity Assessment Bodies (CABs) are capable of performing a wide range of tests and certifications to address the requirements in this highly regulated industry. These include conducting biological and chemical tests to provide analysis on contaminants in food, products’ shelf-lives, as well as certification of food safety management systems (e.g. HACCP and ISO 22000) and food product types (e.g. Halal). Services provided by CABs also support emerging areas in the industry such as health foods and alternative proteins, to ascertain quality of the products. 

Good practices in accordance to international standards can also facilitate market access and trade, because the consistency of conformity assessment results will be recognised across common frameworks. SAC’s Mutual Recognition Agreements with partners such as the International Accreditation Forum (IAF) can further benefit exporters by minimising checks required at the point of arrival in importing countries, hence reducing time to market. These MRAs can be leveraged by using SAC-accredited CABs, which offer greater credibility. 

Singapore Food Agency is the regulatory body governing the food industry in Singapore, and it lays out specific requirements with regard to conformity assessment.

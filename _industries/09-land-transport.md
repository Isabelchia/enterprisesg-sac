The land transport industry comprises of rail and automotive transport systems and vehicles, and is a key component of societyâ€™s infrastructure. Recent emerging trends in the industry include the development of autonomous and electric vehicles, and the use of big data for understanding commuter travel patterns. Elsewhere in the industry, technology is also impacting the ways in which infrastructure is maintained, by enabling predictive maintenance and increasing workplace safety. 

The need to ensure safety and reliability of transport infrastructure and systems underpins all activity in the industry, from technological solutions to vehicle functionality, and conformity assessment is able to provide such assurance. Those of particular relevance to manufacturers of vehicles and infrastructure include functional testing and certification (e.g. ISO 26262), non-destructive testing of equipment and infrastructure components, and civil engineering-related testing. Calibration and measurement may also be necessary, for businesses involved in constructing or operating transport hardware. Validating the safety of vehicles and their parts is imperative as well, so electrical testing may be needed in order to assess compliance to safety requirements. For special vehicles such as waste collection vehicles, hook lift and pressure vessel inspection may be needed to ascertain their functionality and safety.  

Land transport players will also find management systems certifications to be of value to their businesses, both for optimising operations and for demonstrating the quality of management systems. Some examples of applicable certifications are those for quality management (ISO/ TS 16949), environmental management (ISO 14001) and occupational health and safety (ISO 45001). Asset management system certification is another option for businesses operating bus fleets. 

Testing, inspection and certification services such as those outlined above apply to emerging areas of the industry too, as conformity assessment would be necessary to ensure that innovative transport solutions are able to meet safety requirements. However, there may be a greater focus on the technological aspects in this case, as compared to the existing industry needs, due to the heavy involvement of infocommunications technology. 

SAC has accreditation schemes for both laboratories as well as certification bodies who are able to provide the above services to meet the needs of players in the land transport industry, providing added confidence over the quality of existing and emerging infrastructure and technology in the land transport industry.

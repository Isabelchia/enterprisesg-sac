Singapore is a leading logistics and supply chain management hub in the Asia Pacific region, and the industry functions as a key driver of the local economy. Singapore is also a premier global hub port and international maritime centre, with more than 1000 tonnes of cargo being handled in our port each minute. In 2017, the industry contributed 7% of GDP, and demand for supply chain management services has enabled local logistics companies to develop a full range of capabilities across various verticals. 

Given the large volume and sometimes dangerous nature of goods transported by sea, safety and quality are key priorities. Conformity assessment can provide the assurance needed, and may often be required in order to demonstrate compliance to regulatory requirements. 

Inspection bodies are able to provide a wide variety of inspection services, from bunker surveys to hold and hatch inspections, as well as marine asbestos inspections. Testing and inspection may also be conducted on bunker fuel in order to assess conformance to TR 48 specifications. Where relevant, businesses may wish to engage inspection services for cranes and other lifting equipment, to verify their safety.

Certifications also apply to the logistics industry, and those of particular relevance include occupational safety and health management systems, as well as quality management systems. Business continuity management certification may also be important for ensuring the quality of business continuity practices. Certification for standard supply chain security (ISO 28000) is an industry-specific certification that may add value to your business too.

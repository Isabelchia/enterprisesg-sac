![Marine and Offshore Engineering Industry](/images/industries/marine.jpg)

Singapore's marine and offshore (M&O) engineering industry is growing steadily, supported by Singapore's status as a global offshore and marine hub. Businesses based here service worldwide demand for ship repair, shipbuilding, rig-building and offshore engineering, as well as oilfield equipment manufacturing, and the building and chartering of offshore supply vessels. 

Demand for liquefied natural gas (LNG) as a fuel has also been growing, and Singapore is well-placed to become Asiaâ€™s LNG hub. CABs are able to assist companies involved in LNG, with services such as offshore non-destructive testing (NDT) and structural inspection. 

Specific to the industry, M&O inspection covers a wide variety of equipment, including air receivers, power boilers, storage tanks, and pressure relieve valves. SAC has accreditation schemes for inspection bodies (IBs) to perform such services. Certain IBs are also accredited to carry out technical audits of extension schemes for pressure vessels, intended to ensure continual safe use of these vessels during the extended period. In the testing fields, calibration and measurement of equipment and parts can be conducted by SAC-accredited laboratories, in addition to electrical and NDT.

Marine and offshore engineering players will also find management systems certifications to be of value to their businesses, both for optimising operations and for demonstrating the quality of management systems. Some examples of applicable management systems certifications are quality management (ISO 9001), environmental management (ISO 14001) and occupational safety and health (ISO 45001). 

Conformity assessment bodies (CABs) are able to provide relevant services spanning the testing, inspection and certification of products and processes. Those accredited by SAC are able to provide added confidence over the quality of their services.

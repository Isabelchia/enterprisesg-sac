The retail and wholesale trade industry spans a wide range of businesses, and may be either business-to-business or business-to-consumer. Conformity assessment can be helpful to retail and wholesale companies, with several management systems certification programmes available to enable companies to demonstrate compliance to a variety of standards. Those of particular relevance to retailers and wholesale traders include quality management system and business continuity management system. These would enable businesses to validate their existing systems and identify areas for improvement, while providing assurance over the quality of the companyâ€™s processes. Where relevant, businesses may also be able to use such certifications as evidence of their commitment to sustainability as well.

The increasing accessibility and affordability of technological solutions for businesses has resulted in the rise of e-commerce, with the Internet becoming an efficient and cost effective channel of distribution. At the same time, cyber threats are becoming more sophisticated, so consumers are also becoming more conscious of the importance of safeguarding their personal data. Retailers using e-commerce may hence also consider gaining certification for their information security management systems (ISMS). ISO 27001 is an ISMS standard which stipulates requirements for establishing, implementing, monitoring and improving ISMS, helping organisations counter threats of data theft and damage.

SAC has accreditation schemes for conformity assessment bodies offering the conformity assessment services outlined above. Certification from these accredited bodies will enable retailers and wholesalers to provide their customers, whether individual end-users or other businesses, with added assurance and confidence.

In Singapore, different industries are regulated by a governing body such as an agency which may outline specifications or standards that have to be met before goods can be sold or marketed. Refer to individual industry pages for specific examples of how conformity assessment plays a role in your industry.

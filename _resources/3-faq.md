#### What is accreditation?

Accreditation is the endorsement by an authoritative body (such as SAC) of an organisation's competence, credibility, independence and integrity in carrying out its conformity assessment activities, such as testing, calibration, inspection and certification.

#### What is the difference between accreditation and certification?

**Accreditation:**\\
Accreditation is the formal recognition by an accreditation authority of the technical and organisational competence of a conformity assessment body to carry out a specific service in accordance to the standards and technical regulations as described in their scope of accreditation.

**Certification:**\\
Certification is the procedure by which a third party gives written assurance that a product, process, system or person conforms to specified requirements.

ILAC and  IAF have published an informative article titled ["Standards, Conformity Assessment and Accreditation: the Pillars of Assurance in the Global Marketplace"](http://ilac.org/?download=119879){:target="_blank"} in _Standards Engineering_, a bimonthly journal from the Society of Standards Professionals (SES). It explains the differences between standards, certification and accreditation, and how they form the framework to deliver confidence to regulators, industry and end-users.

#### What are the benefits of being accredited?

These are some of the key benefits of being accredited.

**Building Trust**\\
In the global industry, customers are becoming more demanding and seeking assurances on the products and services that you provide them. By getting accreditation, your customers will have the confidence in the quality of products and services that you provide. This will enable you to build trust between you and your customer.

**International Recognition**\\
Through the various mutual recognition arrangements between accreditation bodies, overseas markets will accept your company more readily if they know that you have been certified by an SAC-accredited certification body or accept your test results/inspections if you are an accredited laboratory or inspection body.

**Minimises Risk**\\
Accredited organisations reduce the risk of providing unreliable test results, services and products, and are able to meet the customers' expectations.

**Reduce Costs**\\
Although accreditation comes at a cost, the cost savings that result from being accredited will outweigh the cost of accreditation. Cost savings may result from improved productivity, reduced downtime, less re-testing, etc.

**Demonstrate Credibility**
No organisation will want to spend money on getting a report or certificate that has not been accredited by a competent body. An SAC-accredited organisation is able to demonstrate competence for the report or certificate through its sound management system and the use of trained and competence personnel.

### Frequently Asked Questions on Singapore GLP Compliance Programme

{: #qnb1}
#### What is the difference between GLP recognition and ISO/IEC 17025 accreditation?

GLP is a quality system concerned with the organisation process and conditions under which the non-clinical studies are planned, recorded, archived and reported. ISO/IEC 17025 accreditation is a formal recognition for technical competence to undertake specific tests or calibrations. In general GLP is used for non-clinical health & safety studies that are often called for in regulations while ISO/IEC 17025 accreditation is used normally voluntary. Laboratory accreditation to ISO/IEC 17025 is for routine testing and measurement while GLP covers often a series of experiments. Only GLP recognition can provide an effective quality system that gives regulators the necessary confidence in relation to how non-clinical health and safety studies are planned, performed, monitored, recorded, reported and archived.

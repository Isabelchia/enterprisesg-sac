## About

Accreditation is an endorsement of a certification body’s independence, integrity and technical competence. Most importantly, accreditation provides a certification body with a trust mark and confidence to offer its services nationally and globally.

### About the Schemes

The accreditation programmes under Certification include Product Certification, Quality Management System, Environmental Management System, Occupational Safety and Health Management System, Food Safety Management System based on ISO 22000 and HACCP (Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points), Business Continuity Management System, Energy Management System, Good Distribution Practice for Medical Devices and Quality Management for Bunker Supply Chain, Water Efficiency Management System, Learning Providers, Multi-tiered Cloud Computing Security, End-of-Life ICT Equipment Management, Asset Management, Medical Device-Quality Management System, Auditing Organisation, Anti-Bribery Management System and Certification of Persons.
 
Launched in October 1996, the Accreditation Scheme for Quality Management System Certification Bodies aims to uphold the standards of certification activities in Singapore. The scheme was extended in August 2003 to cover the certification of bunker suppliers, in a show of support for the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore's initiative to highlight Singapore's status as a bunkering hub. In April 2008, the scheme was further extended to cover the certification of good distribution practice of medical devices (GDPMDS). This was an effort to support the Health Sciences Authority's initiative to ensure the quality and integrity of medical devices throughout the distribution process.
 
The Accreditation Scheme for Environmental Management System Certification Bodies and the Accreditation Scheme for Product Certification Bodies were launched in November 1999 and November 2001 respectively. The latter was extended in April 2009 to cover the certification of ready-mixed concrete in a bid to support the Building and Construction Authority's initiative to ensure high quality of ready-mixed concrete.

### Benefits
Accreditation will:

* **Increase confidence**:  
Widely recognised by regulators and the industry, SAC accredited certificates instil greater confidence in those who choose to engage the services of SAC accredited certification bodies. 

* **International recognition**:  
As a member of the Multilateral Recognition Arrangement (MLA) for Quality Management System, Food Safety Management System, Environmental Management System and Product Certification of the Pacific Accreditation Cooperation (PAC) and the International Accreditation Forum (IAF), certificates issued by SAC-accredited certification bodies are globally recognised by MLA members that span across 38 economies. 

### Process
Upon receiving the application for accreditation, qualified assessors are assigned to assess the system of operations of the certification body and the competence of the auditors. This will be carried out through a document review, assessments at the certification body's office as well as on-site witnessed assessments of audits – all conducted by the certification body. When the certification body has demonstrated compliance with our requirements, it will be recommended for accreditation. Once approved, SAC will grant a certificate of accreditation. The detailed description of the type of assessment is stipulated in CT 01, Accreditation Process.
